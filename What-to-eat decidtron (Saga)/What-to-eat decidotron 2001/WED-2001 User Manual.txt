Welcome to What-to-eat decidotron 2001!

To use this program, you need to download what_to_eat_decidotron_2001.py and Restaurant inputs.txt 
and put them in the same folder. 

Restaurant inputs.txt already includes a header, please do not change that. To add your own
restaurant inputs, you need to delete the existing options and replace them with parameters of the 
restaurants of your choosing, and separate them by a comma.
