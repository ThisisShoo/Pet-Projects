## Pet-Projects
My pet projects, the ones that I do for fun. 

The projects I have uploaded here are the ones that have passed the internal test, and are ready to be publicized. Each project is contained within their own folder, called "saga", because I intend to keep adding features to them down the line, like how stories evolve in history as they are being told over and over again.
